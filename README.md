# Cryptography-Project
-By Sameer Dubey, Student from Technocrats institute of technology & Science, Bhopal[M.P.]

:This project mainly focused on user authentication,cryptographic methods used for security of message.

# Goal :
The primary objective of this project was to develop a secure messaging system using cryptographic techniques, encapsulated within the  class. Through this endeavour, we aimed to implement functionalities such as encryption, decryption, digital signature generation, verification, hash generation, and verification to ensure secure communication between parties.

# Problem statement
Let us consider a case where the user sends a text or file from his phone to his friend. The risk of the data being accessed by a third party is high when the data enters the cloud platform. Hence a new method to secure the messages/file is to be done either by building a new algorithm or by modifying the existing one which can give more security and consume less time. The identity of the use must also be verified by using the authentication, verification and validation methodologies.

# Achievements:
The project successfully achieved its objectives by implementing the SecureMessaging class, which provides robust cryptographic functionalities. The class allows users to securely exchange messages while ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

# Tools and Algorithms used for analysis
Python & Cryptography libraries
